A basic Chip8 emulator made for learning more about the way emulators work.

Currently a WIP.

To do:
- Add a delay in order to limit simulation speed
- Get input handling working
- Load a custom ROM at runtime
- Change emulator scale
- Change window size
- Changing the delay
- Pausing
- Playing a single step
- Potentially saving and loading states
